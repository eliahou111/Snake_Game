# Snake_Game
This repository stores my Snake Game that runs on the terminal.
To play, just download all the sourcecode, and because of my included makefile, compilation is simple. 
Just open the terminal, and enter the folder containing all the sourcecode. Then run make.
It will then compile, and you can play the game by running the executable called "game".
>>> make
>>> ./game

Enjoy!
